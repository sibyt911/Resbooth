# Resbooth
In this project we are trying to make a software application by which people would get rewards(Paytm cash) for recycling nonbiodegradable products
such as plastic,styrofoam and e-waste.We would setup booths in various parts of city and those booths would be made to generate code when
someone uses it for recycling purpose. We have included customized Google maps API for checking out nearest booths in this project.
